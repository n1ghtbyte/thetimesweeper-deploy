Create multiple classes (as a Teacher); Student/Parent integration with a Teacher, within a specific class; Generate Formative and Summative assessments; Assess students (as a Teacher); A list of default competences; Create new competences (as a Teacher); View the progress of each student per competence and per indicator." />

  <h2 id="assessments-app-2021-now">Assessments App [2021-now]</h2>
<p>I am currently working on a research project by ERSAMUS+, trying to
understand how can technology affect the life of both students,
parents and teacher in the classroom context. Furthermore, I am
developing an application, the main features alongside the 3 different
interfaces (Student, Parent and Teacher) are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create multiple classes (as a Teacher);</li>
<li>Student/Parent integration with a Teacher, within a specific class;</li>
<li>Generate Formative and Summative assessments;</li>
<li>Assess students (as a Teacher);</li>
<li>A list of default competences;</li>
<li>Create new competences (as a Teacher);</li>
<li>View the progress of each student <em>per</em> competence and <em>per</em>
indicator.</li>
</ul>
<p>The app is still clossed source as agreed with the project manager,
but it the repository will be made public eventually (licensed with GPLv3).</p>
<h2 id="astropi">AstroPi <!-- raw HTML omitted -->[2018/2019]<!-- raw HTML omitted --></h2>
<p>The European Astro Pi Challenge is an ESA Education project run in
collaboration with the Raspberry Pi Foundation,it consists in
conducting a scientific experiment in space. Me and my friends
participated in the <em>Mission Space Lab</em> category, we intended to
demonstrate the validity of <em>Galileo&rsquo;s Theory of Relativity</em>, from an
experimental point of view, using the RaspberryPi. Using a mathematical model deducted, we used the photographs of
the Earth among with their coordinates to calculate the relative velocity
and prove the importance of the Galileo&rsquo;s Theory of Relativity in
experiments with this type of systems. As a secondary mission, we used
the Humidity, Pressure and Temperature sensors to turn the RaspberryPi
into a Human-Presence detector.</p>
<p>All the code, images and final report can be found <a href="https://github.com/n1ghtbyte/Astro-Pi">here</a>.</p>

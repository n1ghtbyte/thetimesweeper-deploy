** Assessments App [2021-now]
I am currently working on a research project by ERSAMUS+, trying to
understand how can technology affect the life of both students,
parents and teacher in the classroom context. Furthermore, I am
developing an application, the main features alongside the 3 different
interfaces (Student, Parent and Teacher) are:
+ Create multiple classes (as a Teacher);
+ Student/Parent integration with a Teacher, within a specific class;
+ Generate Formative and Summative assessments;
+ Assess students (as a Teacher);
+ A list of default competences;
+ Create new competences (as a Teacher);
+ View the progress of each student /per/ competence and /per/
  indicator.
The app is still clossed source as agreed with the project manager,
but it the repository will be made public eventually (licensed with GPLv3).

** AstroPi [2018/2019]
The European Astro Pi Challenge is an ESA Education project run in
collaboration with the Raspberry Pi Foundation,it consists in
conducting a scientific experiment in space. Me and my friends
participated in the /Mission Space Lab/ category, we intended to
demonstrate the validity of /Galileo's Theory of Relativity/, from an
experimental point of view, using the RaspberryPi. Using a mathematical model deducted, we used the photographs of
the Earth among with their coordinates to calculate the relative velocity
and prove the importance of the Galileo's Theory of Relativity in
experiments with this type of systems. As a secondary mission, we used
the Humidity, Pressure and Temperature sensors to turn the RaspberryPi
into a Human-Presence detector.

All the code, images and final report can be found [[https://github.com/n1ghtbyte/Astro-Pi][here]].
